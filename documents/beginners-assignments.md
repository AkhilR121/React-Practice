# Beginner Assignments.

   Read this book for the programs. Programs in this book will teach you how to write beautiful code.
   Download and install jetbrains clion and write all of the programs in the book.
   Make sure you also implement as many exercises as possible. Exercises are as good as the book.

2. [Learn Javscript by Building Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec8vSKJuZTk)

   Code won't be great here. But this will teach you DOM reasonably well.

3. [The last aglorithms course you will need](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/)
