Write the following components using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You shouldn't use any third party css or dom library.

1. Implement a counter component. You should have two button, one for incrementing and another for decrementing count. Something similar to stackoverflow up/down vote component.

2. Write an Accordion component. An accordion is a vertically stacked set of interactive headings that each contain a title, content snippet representing a section of content. The headings function as controls that enable users to reveal or hide their associated sections of content. Accordions are commonly used to reduce the need to scroll when presenting multiple sections of content on a single page.

3. Implement a simple color picker component. You should use three slider controls for 'red', 'green', 'blue' components. Have a simple box to display the selected color.

4. Write a simple calendar month view component. Have two input controls to select month and year. When the selection changes, display that month's calendar.

5. Write a simple image gallery component. You should have a list of images on the left and a large image on the right. When you click on any image in the list, the large image should change to the selected image.
