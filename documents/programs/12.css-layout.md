## CSS Layout assignments

1. Navbar: Create a navbar using Flexbox that has a logo on the left, navigation links in the center, and social media links on the right. The logo and social media links should be aligned vertically with the navigation links.

2. Pricing grid: Create a pricing grid using Flexbox that has three pricing plans side by side. Each pricing plan should have a title, price, and a list of features. The price and features should be aligned vertically. Something similar to [this](https://vercel.com/pricing)

3. Image gallery: Create an image gallery using Flexbox that displays images in a grid. The images should be the same size and have a gap between them. The gallery should also be responsive and adjust the number of columns based on the screen size.

4. Sidebar and content: Create a layout using Flexbox that has a sidebar on the left and content on the right. The sidebar should have a fixed width and the content should fill the remaining space. The sidebar and content should be aligned vertically. Something similar to [this](https://vercel.com/docs)

5. Create a basic grid layout with three columns and two
   rows. Make the first column twice as wide as the second and third columns. Use CSS Grid layout.

6. Create a responsive grid layout that consists of five columns on a wide screen (greater than 800px wide). However, it should automatically adjust to three columns on medium-sized screens (between 500px and 800px wide) and only one column on narrow screens (less than 500px wide). Use media queries.

7. Design a webpage layout using CSS Grid. It should have a header, main content area, sidebar, and footer. Use the grid-template-areas` property to name and define the layout areas.

8. Create a nested grid layout where one of your grid items from the parent grid also becomes a grid container with its own grid items.

9. Create a grid layout with five items. Make it so that the grid automatically adjusts and fills in gaps if one of the grid items is taller than the others. Use the `grid-auto-flow` property.

10. **Grid Alignment**: Create a grid with three columns and three rows. Make all items center aligned both vertically and horizontally in their respective cells. Use appropriate grid alignment properties.

11. Create a grid-based image gallery. The gallery should have four columns and auto rows. Make it responsive so that the number of columns decreases as the viewport width decreases.

**Note**:

1. Do not worry much about Javascript/Typescript. Just CSS is fine. If you want, you could add some interactivity using Javascript/Typescript.
2. Very basic implementations are fine. Above websites are given just to give you an idea of what you need to do. You do not need to implement everything in those websites.
