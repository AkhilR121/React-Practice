## CSS Layout assignments

1. Navbar: Create a navbar using Flexbox that has a logo on the left, navigation links in the center, and social media links on the right. The logo and social media links should be aligned vertically with the navigation links.

2. Pricing grid: Create a pricing grid using Flexbox that has three pricing plans side by side. Each pricing plan should have a title, price, and a list of features. The price and features should be aligned vertically. Something similar to [this](https://vercel.com/pricing)

3. Image gallery: Create an image gallery using Flexbox that displays images in a grid. The images should be the same size and have a gap between them. The gallery should also be responsive and adjust the number of columns based on the screen size.

4. Sidebar and content: Create a layout using Flexbox that has a sidebar on the left and content on the right. The sidebar should have a fixed width and the content should fill the remaining space. The sidebar and content should be aligned vertically. Something similar to [this](https://vercel.com/docs)

**Note**:

1. Do not worry much about Javascript/Typescript. Just CSS is fine. If you want, you could add some interactivity using Javascript/Typescript.
2. Very basic implementations are fine. Above websites are given just to give you an idea of what you need to do. You do not need to implement everything in those websites.
